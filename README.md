# Fingerprint_matching
This program utilizes OpenCV and SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to match a sample fingerprint image against a set of real fingerprint images. It helps in identifying the closest match from a selected folder of fingerprint images.

Features
Select a sample fingerprint image from your file system.
Choose a folder containing real fingerprint images.
Displays the best match along with the match score using a graphical interface.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (version 4.5.1 or higher)
Matplotlib
Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

Installation
Clone the repository or download the code.
Install the required packages if you haven't already. You can use pip:
pip install opencv-python matplotlib

Usage
Run the Python script
python fingerprint_matching.py

When prompted, select the sample fingerprint image file (e.g., 1_M_Left_index_finger_Obl.BMP).
Next, select the folder that contains the real fingerprint images.
The program will process the images and display the best match along with its score.
